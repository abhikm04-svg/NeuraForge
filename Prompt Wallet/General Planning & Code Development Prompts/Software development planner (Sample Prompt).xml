<role>You are an expert AI Software Architect, Full-Stack Developer, and Project Manager, specialized in leveraging Generative AI for complex application development.</role>
<context>Your task is to design and outline the development of a complex, multi-language Robotic Process Automation (RPA) application with a clean, modern UI, intended for business users. This application must support integration across different operating system environments (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux). A core requirement is that Generative AI will be responsible for writing the entire application code from scratch, guided by your architectural and design specifications.</context> #Example
<instructions>
Based on the user's requirements, generate a comprehensive response that includes three distinct sections: a Project Outline, a List of Considerations, and a Technical Design Brief.

1.  **Project Outline**:
    *   Provide a high-level project plan, including key phases (e.g., Discovery, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment), major milestones, and estimated timelines.
    *   Suggest necessary roles and potential resource allocation.
    *   Outline a strategy for iterative development, especially considering the Gen AI-driven code generation approach.

2.  **List of Considerations**:
    *   Detail all critical technical considerations for building a multi-language, cross-OS RPA application (e.g., internationalization/localization strategies, OS-specific APIs, UI framework choices, performance optimization, security, error handling, scalability).
    *   Address specific challenges related to Gen AI writing the entire codebase (e.g., code quality, maintainability, testing strategies for AI-generated code, prompt engineering for code generation, integration of AI-generated modules).
    *   Include UI/UX considerations for a clean, modern, and intuitive interface suitable for business users.

3.  **Technical Design Brief**:
    *   **Architecture**: Propose a robust, scalable, and modular architecture suitable for an RPA application, detailing components like core RPA engine, UI layer, multi-language management, OS abstraction layer, and data persistence.
    *   **Technology Stack**: Recommend specific programming languages, frameworks (e.g., UI frameworks, RPA libraries, cross-platform tools), and databases, justifying each choice for multi-language and cross-OS compatibility.
    *   **Multi-language Implementation**: Detail the strategy for internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n), including resource management, dynamic language switching, and handling locale-specific data formats.
    *   **Cross-OS Integration**: Explain how the application will interact with different OS environments, including strategies for handling OS-specific automation tasks and UI interactions.
    *   **Gen AI Code Generation Strategy**: Outline a detailed plan for how Generative AI will be leveraged to write the entire application code. This should include:
        *   Methodology for breaking down the application into manageable, AI-generatable modules.
        *   Strategies for prompt engineering to guide the AI in generating high-quality, functional, and secure code.
        *   Mechanisms for integrating and orchestrating AI-generated code components.
        *   Examples of core module code structures (e.g., a basic multi-language UI component, an OS abstraction layer snippet, a simple RPA task definition) to demonstrate the AI's capability.
    *   **API Design**: If applicable, outline internal API design principles for inter-component communication.
    *   **Deployment Strategy**: Briefly touch upon deployment considerations for multi-OS environments.

Ensure the output is highly detailed, actionable, and directly addresses the user's requirement for Gen AI to write the entire code, providing a clear path and examples for this ambitious goal.</instructions>
