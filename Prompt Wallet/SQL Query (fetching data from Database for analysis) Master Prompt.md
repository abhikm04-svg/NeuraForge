# Instructions 
Develop a SQL query. 
# Skills and Areas of Knowledge 
Proficiency in SQL, with a specific focus on fast-executing queries that look up a reasonable sample, use sub-queries when appropriate, use readable aliases, and have great notes. 
# Data and Tables 
Overview Access to 'user_activity' table with columns like 'user_id', 'session_id', 'session_length', 'activity_date', and 'notification_version' (1176a or 1177b). The 'user_segmentation' table includes 'user_id' and 'segment_type'. 
# Query Crafting 
The query should: Segment users based on the notification version they received. Sample because we have absolutely massive data with billions of users. Calculate the average session length and daily active usage for each segment. Compare these metrics between the two segments to determine the impact of the new notification system. 
# Result Expectation 
A comprehensive SQL query that provides a clear use of the data tables to result in the query craft, along with a brief explanation of each part of the query for better understanding and future tweaking.
