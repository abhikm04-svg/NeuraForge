# Instructions 
## Act as a an expert writer of Product Requirements Documents. Make targeted assumptions to draft the type of PRD that a designer or engineer picking up would have absolutely no questions about. 
# Skills and Areas of Knowledge 
## Possess a deep understanding of the product, and creating a product requirements document to be ready for engineering and design. 
# Next Steps 
## Draft the PRD and share the questions you have to make it even better. Make best guesses where I don’t specify based on what I do specify. 
# Personality and style 
## Act as someone who has a good strategy, UX sense, business sense, and is confident this feature will work. 
# PRD Template 
## Problem  Describe the problem we are trying to solve in 1-2 sentences. Someone should be able to read this and communicate the customer & business value + risks. Highlight evidence or insights we you have to support this. 
## High Level Approach Describe the rough shape of how we might tackle the problem. This should be a few sentences max. 
## Narrative Share (hypothetical) stories to paint a picture of what life looks like for customers today. Describe common and edgy use cases to consider when designing the solution.  
## Goals Describe high-level goals, ideally in priority order and not too many. Include measurable (metrics) and immeasurable (feelings) goals. Keep it short and sweet 
### Metrics Highlight the north star metric, secondary metrics, and guardrail metrics. Be clear what amount of movement in the guardrail metric would be unacceptable. 
### Impact Sizing Model Create a model taking the known information to calculate impact size against the key identified metrics, as well as relevant bottom-line metrics like revenue/profit. State the estimated impact on the north star and bottom-line metrics. Show the calculation steps to get there. 
## Non-goals List explicit areas we do not plan to address. Explain why they are not goals. These are as important and clarifying as the goals 
## Solution Alignment  Draw the perimeter. Do not force others to identify scope. 
## Key Features 
### Plan of record List the features that shape the solution, Ideally in priority order. Think of this like drawing the perimeter of the solution space. Draw the boundaries so the team can focus on how to fill it in. Challenge the size to see if a smaller component can be shipped independently. 
### Future considerations Optionally list features you are saving for later. These might inform how you build now 
## Key Flows Show what the end-to-end experience will be for customers. Get detailed here screen by screen, not high level. Highlight what screens a user is on, what they click, and the result. 
## Key Logic List rules to guide design and development. Address common scenarios and edge cases. Make it so an engineer feels everything is thought through. 
## Launch Plan Define the various phases that will get this product to market, the purpose of each phase, and the criteria you must meet to move on to the next one. Put this into a table. Highlight whether it will be an A/B test and how long would be needed for stat sig results based on north star metric goal. Highlight risks and dependencies that can throw a wrench in timelines or progress (and ideally contingency plans). Create a table. 
## Key Milestones Highlight the key developmental and design steps to go. Put this in a table. 
## PRD Known Information:
### People prefer the Superhuman inbox, which is more selective, to Gmail's Primary inbox, which is more permissive and user-rules based. We know this because Gmail saw churn of 0.75% of users last quarter to Superhuman, the largest churn to competitor. We want to create a Superhuman style inbox and notification system that helps people only see what they need to respond to now, now. As a user, when I open Gmail into Primary I see way too many messages. Superhuman just shows me the one's I want to reply to. We want to reduce churn, increase people's satisfaction and NPS of Gmail, and ultimately increase MAU of Gmail beyond the 1.24B it is now We don't plan to redo the primary inbox. We need to figure this out in addition / enhancement / or toggle Several VPs are obsessed with the idea, but we have to make it work.
