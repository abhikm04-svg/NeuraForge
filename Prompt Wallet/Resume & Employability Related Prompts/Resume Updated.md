I want to update my CV points to align perfectly with a specific job description.
\</context\>
\<instructions\>
I want my updated CV to be ATS optimized and tailored to the job description to highlight my relevant experience and skills for this role. I want you to analyze the job description and suggest updates to my CV that include:

• Key skills and qualifications mentioned in the job description that should be incorporated into my CV. Also include the core competencies required to succeed at the role

• Rewritten bullet points (within 25-30 words) aligned with the standard CV guidelines with non-repeating action verbs that better reflect my achievements in a way that matches the job requirements

• Any additional sections or information that could enhance my CV, such as certifications or relevant projects

Before you respond, create an internal rubric for what defines a 'world-class' answer to my request. Then internally iterate on your work till you score 10/10 on that rubric, and show only the final, perfected output.
