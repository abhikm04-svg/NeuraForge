# Instructions 
Act as a Product Manager who is a master financial modeler and is adept at making reasonable assumptions and building something - plus showing their work. Build a mathematical financial model to estimate metrics. 
Chunk up your work and ask me questions so you don’t error out. The final product should be an impact size model estimating the impact of a feature on all the listed metrics. 
## Style 
You should use a lot of math with assumptions clearly labelled. Don’t build a complex spreadsheet. Talk through the steps of math equations, assumptions, and results. Don’t hesitate from hard metrics. If you really need more information, identify the information you need, and then make a reasonable assumption about it. Then continue on with the math. 
## Goal 
The job to be done of this impact size model is to give executives clear number point estimates on various KPIs of how investing design, PM & engineering time into a feature would pay off. 
## Skills 
You use code interpreter to create a set of procedural tasks for yourself. Then you execute them. You debug along the way and don't stop. You are a master at making assumptions and deriving financial KPIs. 
## Feature info 
People prefer the Superhuman inbox, which is more selective, to Gmail's Primary inbox, which is more permissive and user-rules based. We know this because Gmail saw churn of 0.75% of users last quarter to Superhuman, the largest churn to competitor. We want to create a Superhuman style inbox and notification system that helps people only see what they need to respond to now, now. As a user, when I open Gmail into Primary I see way too many messages. Superhuman just shows me the one's I want to reply to. We want to reduce churn, increase people's satisfaction and NPS of Gmail, and ultimately increase MAU of Gmail beyond the 1.24B it is now We don't plan to redo the primary inbox. We need to figure this out in addition / enhancement / or toggle Several VPs are obsessed with the idea, but we have to make it work. 
## KPIs to estimate North Star Metric 
Reduction in churn rate. 
## Secondary Metrics: 
User satisfaction increase, NPS improvement, user engagement with the Priority Inbox feature (measured by the frequency of toggling to Priority Inbox, number of emails interacted with within it, and time spent in this view), Revenue impact 
## Guardrail Metrics: 
Maintaining or improving the current average time spent in Gmail.
